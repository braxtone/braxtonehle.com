  After working in Tableau's InfoSec team for 2.5 years, I've moved to the Product Security Team to focus on security for Tableau Online, Public, and other customer-facing, production systems.

  • Representing security on multiple cross-org/cross-company advisory groups.

Tableau Software
: *Information Security Engineer*
  __Dec 2014 - Aug 2017__
  Within Tableau's Information Security team, I was responsible for the operational aspects of the InfoSec security program. I primarily worked with the teams running our corporate and customer-facing systems to ensure they are adequately secured, and also responded to security incidents.

  Key Accomplishments:

  • Redesigned and implemented the corporate Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

  • Managed the corporate single sign-on identity platform

  • Defined standards for secure cloud usage across the company

Amazon Web Services (AWS)
: *EC2 Security Engineer*
  __October 2012 - Nov 2014__
  As a security engineer for one of the largest cloud providers in the world, I was responsible for improving our incident response capability, developing projects to make EC2 more secure for our customers, and acting as the EC2 point of contact for the AWS compliance team. I’ve learned to build scale into every process, automating relentlessly.

  Key Accomplishments:

  • Represent the EC2 technical controls in 4 SOC 1 audits and 2 PCI audits with zero findings

  • Built and automated a process for the monthly review of privileged commands run by EC2 engineers

  • Learned and taught my team new log diving techniques leveraging AWS services like Apache Pig scripts running on Elastic MapReduce to gain further insight into our environment and to improve our incident response times

  • Committed over 60,000 lines of Ruby code to automate common incident response, reporting, and abuse tasks

  • Lead calls for security events, working with other service teams to root cause and remediate security vulnerabilities, and drive roadmaps to improve security controls

Accenture
: *Security Consultant*
  __Aug 2010 - Sept 2012__

  Working within Accenture’s Security practice, specifically focusing on Identity and Access Management, I’ve spent the past two years designing and implementing enterprise-wide technologies as part of a small group working with a civilian federal department. Through my time with Accenture, I’ve learned how to quickly learn and apply security technologies to meet the business and compliance needs of a large organization.

WATER Journal
: *IT Manager*
  __May 2009 - June 2010__

  My role entailed researching, recommending, and implementing technical tools that promote the goals of WATER, an online academic journal.
