So I recently realized how easy it was to add extra things to the front of my domain name and I felt like adding some cool new subdomains.

My Facebook page, [fb.braxtonehle.com](http://fb.braxtonehle.com) now links to my Facebook profile and [yelp.braxtonehle.com](http://yelp.braxtonehle.com) links to my Yelp profile.

And as a bonus, I've got a shiny new email address if anybody wants to shoot me a message(or a thousand messages about enhancing things) which is braxton@braxtonehle.com.

If you have any more cool ideas for things I could tack on to braxtonehle.com, let me know. I'm not sure there's a limit to the number of subdomains you can add so if anybody has any brilliant ideas for really.long.name.braxtonehle.com let me know.
