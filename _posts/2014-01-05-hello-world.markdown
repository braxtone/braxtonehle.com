Hello there! It's been a long time since I've actually had a website configured on my shiny domain. Doing technical work for a living makes it less and less appealing as a hobby, but getting a chance to take on a project to get my website back up and get more familiar with Git(hub), Jekyll, AWS, and more was too much to resist.

So here it is. This site will mainly exist to link to my digital life on other pages, but I do want to start using this as a place to track solutions to interesting problems I've had or lessons learned from other hobbies.

Cheers,
Braxton
