My good friend [Osman](https://surkatty.org/) and I decided to start a podcast about the wonderful
world of information security. We think it's pretty awesome and hope you do too. Check it out at
<http://soundsecurity.braxtonehle.com>

To shamelessly quote ourselves:
> Sound Security is made up of Braxton and Osman, two InfoSec nerds from the Puget Sound who love to
> rant and argue about the rotating cast of miracle cure vendors, brilliant researchers, forced
> acronyms, groan-inducing vulnerabilities, gasp-inducing vulnerabilities, pointy-haired bosses, and
> other-hyphenated-things that make up our beloved security industry.

Cheers!
