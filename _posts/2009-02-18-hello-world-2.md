Welcome to my new blog.

I'm going to be honest, I don't really know what I want to do with this. I wanted to see how difficult it would be to set one of these things up and it was surprisingly easy. The downside of that is that I never really had a plan for what I would do if it actually worked.

Mostly I figure it will feature my semi-coherent ramblings about whatever topic holds my interest at that particular time. I think I want do some how-to's, short articles about interesting links or technologies I come across, and maybe a social commentary or too(mostly because that is just a cool phrase).

Hope yall enjoy the ride as much as I intend to.
