Usually I err on the side of cynicism, but these videos were pretty cool. From the back stories I've read, there was a group of people who went around the world with a laptop, mic, and a pair of headphones. They had local musicians from around the world listen to the song and play along. Their contributions are mixed together and the result is pretty impressive.

The link to the project's website is: [Playing For Change][1]

The first video gives you a sense of how the video came together, the second is an awesome expansion on that theme.
