I've had a few requests over the past couple of days asking about how to best break into the information security industry and get up to speed with what's going on. While I'll always recommend [Silence on the Wire][1] and pretty much anything put out by No Starch Press or O'Reilly, one of the best ways to keep up to date is to be constantly reading the news to keep current.

One of the better tools I've recently discovered to be able to keep up with multiple new sites at once is using RSS as managed by [Google Reader][2]. The UI is very intuitive and mirrors how I actually read the news. To help any current or aspiring information security professionals keep up to date, I've attached a file that you can upload to Google Reader that will import all the feeds that I follow. Download the XML file from [here][3]. You can upload it to Reader via the [Settings>Import/Export][4] menu.

If you have any go-to resources, I'd love to hear about them. Let me know in the comments.

*Update*

I figured there there would be an easier way than the above importing process and it seems there is. The above procedure will give you access to all the feeds that I subscribe to so that you can pick what you find interesting. The link posted below will show you stories within that feed that I find interesting(and elect to share).
