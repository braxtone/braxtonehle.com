Hey all,

It's been forever since I've updated this blog and the blame for that is best distributed between finishing up college, work and the host of other things I sign myself up for. After I finish up some pertinent things(namely graduating), I'll put some time into updating the whole braxtonehle.com domain and tweaking the look and feel of it.

Til then, I leave you with some interesting links for your learning pleasure:

**A few basic updates:**

Look to the right and you'll see a live list of the most recent things I've found interesting on my [Google Reader feeds][1]

I've created a new [PGP key][2]([what the heck is that?][3]) and uploaded it to the major keyservers. It is also linked to in the main navigation at the top of the page.

**Articles, Videos and Books:**

[Marcus Ranum][4] on how [small system insecurities and flaws can snowball][5] and cost millions down the road.

[IPillion.com][6] &#8211; Have an IP that's scanning or doing bad things to your server(s)? Check out this list and see where it's coming from and who else has had issues with them.

[Terry Gray's Staff Page][7] - Terry is an Associate VP for UW IT that has published a series of very interesting [papers][8] and [presentations][9] that provide a unique insight into things like [network security][10] and [copyright enforcement][11]

[Surprising Science of Motivation][12] - Dan Pink outlines a different way of motivating people in organizations that challenges the idea of more money = more productivity.

[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team][13] - Recommended to me by a very gifted project manager, this book outlines the fundamentals of an effective team in a story format that is actually interested. This book arrived from the internets today at 4, I innocently started it only to realize 2 hours later that I had not moved from my chair and finished the book. Buy it, read it, use it.

Check back in a week for some major updates!
